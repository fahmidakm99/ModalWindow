        <h2>Modal</h2>
        <p>
            A modal is a pop-up window or dialog box that appears on top of the main content of a webpage, temporarily disabling interactions with the main page until the modal is closed. Modals are typically used to:
Display important information, like warnings or notifications.
Collect user input, like login or registration forms.
Showcase images, videos, or content without redirecting the user.
Characteristics of a Modal:
Overlays: They often appear with a semi-transparent overlay that dims the background, focusing attention on the modal content.
Layered on Top: Modals stay above the main content, often centered on the screen.
Temporary Interaction: Users must close the modal to continue interacting with the rest of the page.
Closable: Modals generally have a close button (like an "X" icon) and can often be closed by clicking outside the modal.
Modals are useful in keeping users on the same page while delivering important messages or capturing data without disrupting the overall user experience.
